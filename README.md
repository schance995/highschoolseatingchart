A high school team project to sort students for a summer math boot camp.

The goal is to arrange students such that female students are placed next to each other and students from a particular middle school are placed away from each other.

I programmed ~90% of this project in 2016 as part of my AP Computer Science class.

Unfortunately you can't actually run the program without installing Eclipse and a handful of libraries:

- commons-collections4-4.1.jar
- poi-ooxml-schemas-3.16.jar
- xmlbeans-2.6.0.jar
- poi-ooxml-3.16.jar
- JavaFX11 (which is not included with Java SDK)

To compensate, I've uploaded images and sample data so you can get a feel for this software.
