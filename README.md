A high school team project to sort students for a summer math boot camp.

The goal is to arrange students such that female students are placed next to each other and students from a particular middle school are placed away from each other.

I programmed ~90% of this project in 2016 as part of my AP Computer Science class.

Unfortunately you can't actually run the program without installing Eclipse and a handful of libraries.

I've uploaded images and sample data so you can get a feel for this software.
